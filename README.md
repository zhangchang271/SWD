## Description
Skeletonized Wave-Equation Dispersion Spectrum Inversion (SWD), is a cutting-edge method in geophysical research aimed at obtaining a robust and reliable near-surface S-wave velocity structure. This method leverages a skeletal inversion framework that avoids traditional full waveform inversion's susceptibility to cycle-skipping by implementing a smooth gradient approximation between the dispersion spectrum and the misfit function. This is achieved through the SoftMax approximation.

The technique innovatively derives the gradient of the misfit function with respect to the velocity model utilizing the chain rule and adjoint state method. This integration allows SWD to couple with the wave equation, enabling precise and stable S-wave velocity inversions. Unlike conventional methods, SWD does not depend on a layered assumption, thus enhancing lateral resolution significantly.

SWD capitalizes on the concept of skeletonizing complex surface wave arrivals into simpler formsâ€”specifically, picked dispersion curves in the phase-velocity and frequency domains, akin to wave-equation traveltime tomography. These dispersion curves are primarily obtained from Rayleigh waves captured by vertical-component geophones. The misfit function itself is defined as the sum of the squared differences between the wavenumbers of the predicted and observed dispersion curves, reflecting the method's refined approach to accurately capturing subsurface velocity structures.

## Key Features
- Mid-high resolution compared to FWI.
- No need to estiamte source wavelet.
- The finite difference forward and inverse kernels are accelerated by C++.
- Suitable for elastic wave and flat surface conditions.

   
## Usage
Both single-precision and double-precision versions are provided. Single-precision reduces memory requirements by half compared to double-precision, and the forward modeling speed is 5-10 times faster, but the inversion results may be slightly different each time.

SWD.m or SWD_single.m contains a model test, which are the double-precision and single-precision versions, respectively. 
SWD.mlx is a MATLAB live script (similar to Jupyter) that details the intermediate steps of the SWD program. 
The fieldexamples folder contains two field examples, including processed dispersion curves, the main run file, and an mlx file that explains parameter selection in detail.


The code switches between WD and SWD methods by calling different gradient calculation functions:
- **WD method**: call `weight_data_muti3` function 
- **SWD method**: call `ADWDgrad_1` function (default)
